Just added a ReadMe for this, my first ever actual did-it-myself project

Takes Red, Blue and Green (RGB) values in a form and displays the respective colour. 
To use, open "optionsPage.html" in any browser. This is my first little personal something....only the rgb option works for now. 
You enter any number from 0 to 225 and it gives you a colour on the window above the input elements. 

Have Fun!!
